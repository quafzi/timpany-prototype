This is FCK with some light patches to style it for P'unk Avenue's projects. 
As of this writing it's FCK 2.6.4. We intend to keep it in sync.

You shouldn't necessarily have to use it in order to use our CMS plugin, etc.
The stock FCK should work for you too. We wanted to get rid of the file type
categories stuff that doesn't really work all that well.
