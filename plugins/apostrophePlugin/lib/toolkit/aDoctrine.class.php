  // Used to order the results of a query according to a specific list of IDs. 
  // If we used FIELD we would be limited to MySQL. So we use CASE instead (SQL92 standard).
  
  // Note that you are still responsible for adding a whereIn clause, if you
  // want to limit the results to this list of ids. If you don't, any extra objects
  // will be returned at the end.
  
  // YOU NEED TO HAVE AN EXPLICIT SELECT CLAUSE, if you don't the select clause added by this
  // method will override the default 'select everything' behavior and you will
  // get back nothing! I get burned by this myself.
  
  // Example: 
  //
  // $q = Doctrine::getTable('aMediaItem')->createQuery('m')->select('m.*'->whereIn('m.id', $ids);
  // $mediaItems = aDoctrine::orderByList($q, $ids)->execute();
