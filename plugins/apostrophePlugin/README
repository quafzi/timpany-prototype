# Apostrophe

Welcome to the 1.0 stable release of Apostrophe! Although this is our first official stable release, our CMS is already in regular use on a number of production sites. This release reflects the fact that our code has been stable and ready for your professional use for quite some time.

For complete and extensive documentation of Apostrophe please visit
[trac.apostrophenow.org](http://trac.apostrophenow.org/wiki/ManualOverview). There you'll find a complete manual organized much more conveniently than is possible with a README file.
